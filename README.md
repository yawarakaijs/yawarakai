### 1.4.2
Scene Update
1. Code organization according to Codacy
2. Database seperated into different groups
3. Feature: Scene added and component API adapted   
Scene is designed for the stage control, **scene**, which is the meaning itself,
the situation. Based on different situation, messages or commands may be
processed differently, this won't effect the inline, channel post, callbackquery.   
Scene will only take place when the message or the trigger command has been 
executed, when a user is inside the scene, Yawarakai will ignore the other
message distributor or the processor to the other components, the user's
message will be redirected to the scene registered function to process in its
own.
This made a great experience where you need to make a wizard or make a short or
'question' based setup while in the interaction with user.
